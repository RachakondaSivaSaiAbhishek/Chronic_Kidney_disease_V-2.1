# Chronic_Kidney_disease_V-2.1
We have used a Machine learning approach for predicting if a patient has CKD. This project involves  Classification ML algorithm Logistic Regression. Our accuracy is above 97% .The chronic kidney disease dataset contains both categorical and numeric features, but contains lots of missing values. The goal here is to predict who has chronic kidney disease given as features.

The dataset can be download from Kaggle and other  Machine Learning Repository.

We have used FLASK for deployment in localhost that takes 24 attributes of Chronic Kidney disease for Binary classification.
